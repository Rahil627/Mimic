# Mimic-Battle
A local 1v1 iPad battle game, with the playfulness of HORSE, the playground game.


According to a commit note, this is where I gave up on Cocos2D, and, apparently much later, tried to implement this idea again with HaxePunk. I believe I was just struggling to do something that should have been really simple but wasn't: drawing primitive graphics with Cocos2D / OpenGL ES.
